# Moto-Roach
In this project an adaptive walking algorithm is developed for a hexapod robot (Moto-Roach) with each leg having 3 degrees of freedom. The algorithm has the ability to adapt its walking gait ie it should vary its walking speed and change its walking gait in accordance with the roughness of the terrain. The various applications of this project include search and rescue, surveillance, terrain mapping etc.
